            "Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.",
            "Prepare Pesto: In a food processor, combine basil leaves, sunflower seeds, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. Pulse until finely chopped.",
            "Add Olive Oil: With the processor running, slowly add olive oil until the mixture is smooth. Season with salt and pepper.",
            "Combine Pasta and Sauce: Drain pasta and return it to the pot. Add the pesto sauce and toss to coat evenly.",
            "Serve: Serve hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired."

    },
    "Explanation": "The original recipe is not safe for someone with a nut allergy, as it contains pine nuts. The modified recipe replaces pine nuts with sunflower seeds, which are seeds and generally safe for people with nut allergies. This modification makes the dish nut-free while maintaining the classic pesto flavor."
