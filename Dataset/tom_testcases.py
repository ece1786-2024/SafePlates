            "3 cups cooked brown rice",
            "1 cup broccoli florets",
            "1 cup sliced carrots",
            "½ cup low-sodium teriyaki sauce",
            "2 tablespoons sesame oil",
            "1 tablespoon minced garlic",

        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe bananas",

            "Blend: In a blender, combine the bananas, cow's milk, chia seeds, honey, and cinnamon.",
            "Add Ice: Add a handful of ice cubes to the blender for a chilled smoothie.",

            "Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately."
        ]
    },
    "modified_recipe": {

}

##replace the milk with goat milk.


### 4. Allergen Cross-Reactivity: The recipe includes ingredients that can cause cross-reactivity in individuals with certain allergies. For instance, someone allergic to latex might also react to foods like bananas or avocados.

{
    "dish_name": "Strawberry Smoothie",
    "restriction": "Latex Allergy, no berry",
    "original_recipe": {
        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe Strawberry",
            "1 cup almond milk",
            "1 tablespoon chia seeds",
            "1 tablespoon honey",
            "½ teaspoon cinnamon",
            "Ice cubes as needed"
        ],
        "steps": [
            "Prepare Ingredients: Peel the Strawberry and gather all other ingredients.",
            "Blend: In a blender, combine the Strawberry, almond milk, chia seeds, honey, and cinnamon.",
            "Add Ice: Add a handful of ice cubes to the blender for a chilled smoothie.",
            "Blend Until Smooth: Blend all ingredients on high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy.",
            "Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately."
        ]
    },
    "modified_recipe": {
        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe avocados",
            "1 cup coconut milk",
            "1 tablespoon flaxseeds",
            "1 tablespoon maple syrup",
            "½ teaspoon turmeric",
            "Ice cubes as needed"
        ],
        "steps": [
            "Prepare Ingredients: Scoop the avocados and gather all other ingredients.",
            "Blend: In a blender, combine the avocados, coconut milk, flaxseeds, maple syrup, turmeric, and ice cubes.",
            "Blend Until Smooth: Blend all ingredients on high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy.",
            "Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately."
        ]
    },
    "Explanation": " The modified recipe substitutes bananas with avocados, but avocados are  known to trigger latex cross-reactivity. Therefore, the modified recipe still poses a risk to individuals with latex allergies."
}

## Substitutes bananas with avocados, which are also cross-reactive for individuals with latex allergies. This substitution does not solve the issue and still poses a risk.


### 5.Ambiguous Ingredient Names: The recipe uses ingredient names that could potentially violate the requirements. For example, for nut-free case instead of mention using nut-free butter but just butter.

{
    "dish_name": "Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie",
    "restriction": "Nut-Free",
    "original_recipe": {
        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe bananas",
            "1 cup almond milk",
            "2 tablespoons peanut butter",
            "1 tablespoon honey",
            "½ teaspoon cinnamon",
            "Ice cubes as needed"
        ],
        "steps": [
            "Prepare Ingredients: Peel the bananas and gather all other ingredients.",
            "Blend: In a blender, combine the bananas, almond milk, peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon.",
            "Add Ice: Add a handful of ice cubes to the blender for a chilled smoothie.",
            "Blend Until Smooth: Blend all ingredients on high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy.",
            "Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately."
        ]
    },
    "modified_recipe": {
        "ingredients": [
            "2 ripe bananas",
            "1 cup almond milk",
            "2 tablespoons butter",
            "1 tablespoon maple syrup",
            "½ teaspoon cinnamon",
            "Ice cubes as needed"
        ],
        "steps": [
            "Prepare Ingredients: Peel the bananas and gather all other ingredients.",
            "Blend: In a blender, combine the bananas, almond milk, butter, maple syrup, and cinnamon.",
            "Add Ice: Add a handful of ice cubes to the blender for a chilled smoothie.",
            "Blend Until Smooth: Blend all ingredients on high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy.",
            "Serve: Pour the smoothie into glasses and serve immediately."
        ]
    },
    "Explanation": "The original recipe is not safe for a nut-free diet as it includes peanut butter and almond milk, both of which are nut products. The modified recipe replaces peanut butter with 'butter,' which is ambiguous and could cause confusion. It also retains almond milk, which is derived from nuts. The ambiguity of 'butter' and the inclusion of almond milk require caution, as they may not be safe for individuals with nut allergies."
}

    "dish_name": "Ginger Turmeric Smoothie",
    "restriction": "I like stronger flavour",
