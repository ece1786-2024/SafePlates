----------------------
result: Caution

- Ingredient Safety & Requirement Fulfillment: The substitution of cow's milk with goat milk does not meet the lactose-free requirement. Goat milk contains lactose, so this modification does not fulfill the lactose-free dietary restriction.

- Cooking Steps & Ingredient Safety: Including a raw egg in a smoothie poses a risk due to potential salmonella contamination. Consider using pasteurized eggs or omitting the egg to enhance safety.

Ensure that any milk substitute used is explicitly lactose-free, such as almond milk, soy milk, or another certified lactose-free alternative.
